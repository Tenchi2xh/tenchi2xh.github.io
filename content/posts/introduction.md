description: Hello, World!
title: Introduction
---

Welcome to `/* COMMENT BLOCKS */`, my little web log where I will share with you everything about the progress on my *personal projects*, as well as interesting challenges, findings or techniques regarding *programming*, and other random stuff.

My name is Hamza Haiken (or *Tenchi* <img class="inline-image" src="/images/hanko.png" /> on the internet). I have been programming and tinkering with computers ever since I was little and continue doing so every day as a hobby.

I was born in Switzerland where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering in the HEIG-VD. I now live in the Netherlands where I work as a Software Developer in a major IT consulting company.

Also, I happen to be the only member of *team2xh* <img class="inline-image" src="http://team2xh.net/team2xh.png" /> which totally is a *real* coding group that focuses on doing exactly what I like to do :o)

What do I like? Prototyping crazy ideas, coding my way through life, discovering new technologies but also very old ones. Language wise, I really enjoy developing in *Python* and *Scala*. I enjoy putting to code everything that crosses my mind and trying new ideas.

I also play [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29), where my rank seems to hover at around 5 kyu, and like to play VS-Fighting games like Street Fighter on my home made arcade stick.

Recently, I grew to like [Pyth](https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth), a [code golfing](codegolf.stackexchange.com) language, trying to solve puzzles with the shortest code possible. Just to get an idea of how concise the language was aimed to be, here is my version of a program that will output a zoomed-out plot of the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), coded with only 72 characters:

```
=k_smCdr32+32yTK23DvbJbVyT=J+*JJbI>.aJTRN)RNVr_KKsm@kv.jcd30cN15r_+TyKK
```

Which, when run with Pyth, outputs the following lines in the terminal (output was shortened a bit to fit the layout):

```

I think that this little example (and the whole introduction) will make you understand what kind of *geek* I am, and, if you get the feeling you'll learn a thing or two, please enjoy reading my other posts :)

I will try my best to write here regularly, and to give you a taste of what's to come, here's a non-exhaustive list of past and future projects I'd like to talk about:

- [Almonds](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Almonds), a terminal-based Mandelbrot set explorer (`pip install almonds`)
- [Falcon](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Falcon), a music box punchcard writer
- [Scurses](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Scurses#scurses), a no-dependency `ncurses` for Scala
- [Onions](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Scurses#onions), a UI / dashboard API for Scurses
- My recent Chrome extension coding spree, and how easy it is to write them
- Trying out [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Experimenting with [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
- [Code golfing](codegolf.stackexchange.com) and [Pyth](https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth)
- Using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) for the first time and creating this blog
- <s>ULTRA SECRET PROJECT</s> Kotan ([枯淡](http://jisho.org/word/枯淡)), a web application for playing Go online, with lots of innovative features (I feel like the world of online Go has been stagnating for a long time)
